## Warm up programs

1. Find the only odd occuring element in a given array. For example for an array {4,3,2,2,4,5,3} the output is 5 as 5 appears odd number of times.

2. Find two odd occurring elements in an array where all other occur even times (extension of above problem)
For example for an array {4,3,2,2,4,5,3,4,7,4} the output is 5 and 7 as 5 and 7 appears odd number of times.
